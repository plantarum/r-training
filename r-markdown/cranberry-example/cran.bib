  abstract =	 {The ploidy level of plants of the Vaccinium sect.Oxycoccus (Hill)W.D.J.
                  Koch sampled in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Poland was
                  determined by chromosome counting and/or by flow cytometry. Forty-five
                  characters were measured and scored in the morphometric analysis.
                  Principal component analysis, cluster analysis, canonical discriminant
                  analysis and classificatory discriminant analysis were used in the
                  statistical analyses. Diploid (2n=24), tetraploid (2n=48) and hexaploid
                  (2n=72) populations were confirmed and a new ploidy level - pentaploid
                  hybrid plants (2n=60) - was revealed. Results of the multivariate
                  morphometric analysis support the separation of the two native species.
                  Diploid V. microcarpum ( Turcz . ex Rupr. ) Schmalh . differs from the
                  polyploids by smaller size of petals, shorter style and stamens (stamens
                  have long filaments and short anthers), glabrous pedicels, mostly
                  solitary flowers, earlier flowering and by occurrence predominantly in
                  Polytrichum strictum tufts. The low taxonomic significance of some
                  features often used in keys for their separation (shape of fruits,
                  insertion of prophylla, pubescence of filaments) was confirmed. V.
                  oxycoccos L. includes three ploidy levels. The hexaploids represent the
                  most abundant ploidy level in the area studied. They show a slightly
                  bigger size of petals, longer bracts, prophylla, style, sepal tips and
                  wider seeds in comparison with the tetraploids. Pentaploid cranberries
                  are hitherto known only from the Czech Republic. They differ
                  particularly in the low proportion of fully-developed tetrads.},
