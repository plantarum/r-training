### basics

This is material for a one-day introduction to R:

1. first_session.Rmd
2. data_manipulation.R
3. input-output.R
4. package_management.Rmd
5. plotting.R
6. r-programming.R

The R script files are designed to be worked through as a group,
alternating between me demonstrating different things, and the students
working through short exercises on their own to reinforce the demos.

The Rmd files are shorter, mostly lecture material. I have also included
notes from my most recent delivery. This is a work in progress, and I've
indicated what some of the rougher parts are so far.

### base-graphics

A new lesson featuring a walk-through of the process I use for preparing
publication-ready figures using the base R graphics system.

### r-markdown

An overview of Reproducible Research, and a workflow for achieving it
with R, Markdown and RStudio. Primarily a lecture, with material
repurposed from Roger Peng's Coursera material:

### packages

An demonstration outlining the process for creating, installing and
building an R package. At the completion of the demonstration, you
should be able to create your own R package, and understand enough to
make sense of the copious documentation provided with R.
